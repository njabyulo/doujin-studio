## Executive Summary

I've built a working proof-of-concept AI ad creation tool that demonstrates the core functionality you're looking for. This POC leverages existing APIs and open-source tools to create a cost-effective, production-ready solution similar to Vibe Studio.

## What I've Built

### Core Features (Implemented)
- **AI Script Generation**: URL-to-ad conversion using Google Gemini AI
- **30-Second Video Ads**: Programmatic video rendering with Remotion
- **Real-Time Preview**: Interactive video player with scene-by-scene editing
- **Full Customization**: Edit text overlays, colors, fonts, timing, and scene duration
- **Professional Output**: Export to MP4 with customizable branding

### Technical Stack (Cost-Effective)
- **AI**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (affordable, high-quality)
- **Video Rendering**: Remotion (open-source, React-based)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 (modern, fast, SEO-friendly)
- **Backend**: Serverless functions (pay-per-use, scales automatically)
- **Infrastructure**: AWS Lambda + S3 (cost-effective at scale)

---

## How It Works

1. **Input**: User provides a URL (website, product page, etc.)
2. **AI Analysis**: Gemini AI analyzes content and generates compelling ad script with 3-6 scenes
3. **Customization**: User edits text, colors, fonts, timing in real-time preview
4. **Rendering**: Remotion generates professional 30-second video
5. **Export**: Download MP4 ready for social media, ads, etc.

## Why This Approach

### ✅ Cost-Effective
- Uses existing APIs (Google Gemini, AWS services)
- Open-source video rendering (Remotion)
- Serverless architecture (pay only for usage)
- No expensive custom ML models

### ✅ Production-Ready
- Built with enterprise-grade tools (Next.js, AWS)
- Scalable architecture (handles 1 user or 10,000)
- Modern tech stack with strong community support

### ✅ Extensible
- Easy to add new templates
- Can integrate additional AI providers
- Modular architecture for future features
